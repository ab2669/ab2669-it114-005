<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The dice roller was implemented by adding the <code>handleDiceRoll</code> method on the server<br>file. The method takes in commands like &quot;roll 2d6&quot; and then generates random<br>rolls by using a for loop. Its total then gets calculated the total<br>and the server broadcasts the result to all connected clients. Clients send roll<br>commands to the server, which then processes and shares the result.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The flip coin command is implemented in the Server class and processed in<br>the ServerThread class. When a client sends the command, the server checks for<br>&quot;flip&quot; in the client&#39;s input.

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I had to fix some troubleshooting problems with the code startup. When I<br>tried to compile the server and the 3 clients in all using gitbash,<br>I would receive errors in Server.java for no reason.
